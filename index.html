<p class="tab"><font face="Centaur" size="+1"><p><blockquote>My name is Ashley James.  Currently, I go to school full-time at California State University at Monterey Bay where I am finishing my Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Information Systems.  Besides being a student, I work full time as a Registration Specialist and Compliance Officer for a small fertilizer company located in Paso Robles, CA and part-time at night for The Catalyst Club in Santa Cruz, CA. </p></blockquote>
<p><blockquote>Previously I have worked in several industries that include, but are not limited to; Non-Profit Hippotherapy, Customer Service, Manufacturing Sales, Retail Sales, Veterinary Medicine, Real Estate, Medical Records, Health and Human Services, and Entertainment.</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>Besides work and school, I also enjoy a plethora of outdoor hobbies.  I love horseback riding, hiking, camping, and traveling by car or trips by plane.  I equally love the ocean and all the beautiful mysteries it holds, and the mountains that keep pristine lakes and evergreen forests.  My favorite seasons of year are Spring and Fall because both boast bright colors and crisp, fragrant air.</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>I grew up as the youngest, and only girl, in a family of three boys.  My brothers are 36, 41, and 45 and are married with families. Besides them I also have a foster sister who has been my closest friend since we were both 11 years old. She is also married with children. Between the four of them I have seven nephews, and four nieces.  I love being able to watch them grow, and spoil them in a way that only an aunt, can.</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>My parents are still living in the beautiful foothills of El Dorado County in a house that I spent the last 16 years growing up in.  I enjoy traveling to visit and stay with them as much as possible.</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>Thank you for visiting my page and learning more about me.  I hope you enjoy!</blockquote></p>

			<p>Since I was very young I have always been very fond of animals, and horses in particular.  As I grew up I developed a passion for learning as much about horses as I possibly could.</p>
			<p>Luckily, my parents quickly realized my dedicated love for horses, and recognized that in order to prevent me from driving them insane with horse-related questions and pleadings for a Christmas pony, that they would need to defer my persistence to a qualified professional.  Thus, at the precocious age of 6 years old I was introduced into horse-lessons.  Now, I call these horse-lessons because I did not start off riding horses immediately.  My parents, bless their souls, wanted to really test my dedication to horses by making earn my lessons.  The short translation of this is that I spent the first 8-weeks of my introductory course to horses, shoveling manure. I believe that in some way my parents figured that if anything would discourage me from wanting to pursue climbing aboard one of these gigantic animals and riding majestically into the sunset: poop would be the answer. Almost 26 years later, I can safely say, they were wrong.</p>

			<p>I have spent the last 25 years of my life studying and learning as much about these powerfully gorgeous and fascinating animals, as I could possibly handle.  I have followed incredible trainers such as Stacy Westfall, please see YouTube video below, and worked for veterinarians in several counties throughout California to try and master all aspects of the horse.</p><br><br>
